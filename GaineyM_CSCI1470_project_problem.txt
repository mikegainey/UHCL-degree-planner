My project will help UHCL Computer Science B.S. students choose courses to take in the next term.  It will present a list of only the courses that the student is eligible to take.  It will also help the student map out their degree plan through graduation.

This process is confusing for some students because many courses have prerequisites.  Upper-level CSCI and CENG courses can't be taken until the lower-level core is complete.  The lists of courses that satisfy requirements for language, philosophy, and culture; creative arts; and social/behavioral science are not listed on the two-page degree plan and might be hard to find for students not used to reading university course catalogs.
