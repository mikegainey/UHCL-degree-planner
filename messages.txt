Are you a Computer Science B.S. student and don't know what courses to take next term?  Then run this program!

This program will help you choose courses to take next term and each successive term until graduation.

First, tell the program what courses you have already completed.  You can enter them one-at-a-time at the keyboard and/or you can enter a file name with a list of courses.

In the file, list courses (in the format: CSCI 1470) one per line.  Anything after the course on the line will be ignored and lines that don't start with courses will also be ignored.  Courses that don't apply to the Computer Science B.S. degree will be ignored.  That program will acknowledge the courses that are recognized.

Then, enter your starting term.

Then, you will see a list of courses that you are eligible to take.  Courses with unmet prerequisites will not be shown.  Upper-level CSCI and CENG courses and electives will not be shown until your CS Lower-level core is complete.  Choose courses by menu number and press <Enter> again after your last course.  Then program will restate your choices before moving to the next term.

After you have chosen all of your courses, the program will display a complete degree plan summary.  If you enter a file name, the summary will be saved as a text file in the same folder as the program.

Note: This program uses course information and degree requirements from the UHCL 2017-2018 undergraduate catalog.  If you started your degree in another school year, then you should follow that year's catalog for your degree requirements.  

Note: Labs are wrapped up with the courses they are taken with.

Fine print: Course work that needs to be done in residence.  Grade requirements.  Etc.
