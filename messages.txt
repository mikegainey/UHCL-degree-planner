================================================================================

If you are a UHCL Computer Science B.S. student, this program will help you
choose courses to take next term and each successive term until graduation.

First, tell the program the courses you have already completed.  You can enter
them one-at-a-time at the keyboard and/or you can enter a file name with a list
of courses.

In the file, list course numbers (like CSCI 1470) one-per-line.  Anything on the
line after the course number will be ignored so you can include notes after
course numbers or on separate lines.

After entering your starting term, you will see a menu of courses that you are
eligible to take.  Choose courses for the term by menu number.  The program will
then restate your choices and ask you to verify them before moving to the next
term.

Next to many courses in the list, there will be something that looks like
"(prereq for # courses)."  It shows that the listed course is a prerequisite for
the given number of other courses.  Since you can't take those other courses
until this course is completed, its a good idea to prioritize taking courses
that are prerequisites for others.  Calculus I is a good example.

After you have chosen all of your courses, the program will display your
complete degree plan summary.  If you enter a file name, the summary will be
saved as a text file in the same folder as the program.

Note: This program uses course information and degree requirements from the UHCL
2017-2018 undergraduate catalog.  If you started your degree in another school
year, then you should follow that year's catalog for your degree requirements.
