# UHCL-degree-planner

## Purpose
This program will help UHCL Computer Science B.S. students select courses for the next term and all subsequent terms until graduation.

## Product Features
- Students will be presented with a list of only the courses eligible to be taken for each term.  Courses that have unmet prerequisites will not be shown.  Upper-Level CSCI and CENG courses will not be shown until the CS Lower-Level Core is completed. 
- For each course that can be taken, the number of other courses for which that course is a prerequisite will be shown.  This should encourage students to prioritize taking courses that are prerequisites of other courses.
- At the beginning of the program, students can indicate courses already completed at the keyboard and/or from an input file.
- After choosing courses for each term until all requirements are completed, students will be presented with a degree plan summary that can also be saved to a file.

## Details
- The program file is `UHCLdegreeplanner.py`.  It was developed using Python 3.6.3 on a computer running Ubuntu 17.10 GNU/Linux.
- See `input.txt` for an example of a file containing completed courses to add.
- See `output.txt` for an example of a degree plan summary.

- This program uses requirements found in the 2017-2018 catalog.  It may not be in sync with catalogs from other years.
