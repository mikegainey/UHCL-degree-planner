Rule: Students must finish the LLC before enrolling in upper-level (3000-level) CS or CSE courses.

2016-17 Undergraduate Catalog, p. 268-269:
The courses listed below (or equivalent courses as approved by the departmental academic adviser) are considered the
Lower-Level Core (LLC) for Computer Science and must be completed with a grade of C- or better and a cumulative GPA of
2.5 or higher:
CSCI 1470, CSCI 1471, CSCI 2315, PHYS 2325 and lab, PHYS 2326 and lab, MATH 2413, MATH 2414, MATH 2305 and WRIT 1301.

Students may enroll in upper-level (3000-level) Computer Science or Computer Engineering courses after successfully
completing the Computer Science LLC.  Admission to upper-level status will be granted to students who successfully
complete the Computer Science LLC courses during their freshman or sophomore years and have an overall UHCL GPA of 2.5
or higher.
